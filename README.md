# NextGreaterNumber
## Introduction
This program will read the user input string from console, validate it as a number then return the next greater number by reordering the digits. If the given string is not a valid number or there is no greater number than the given one, an error message will be displayed to user.
## Assumptions
1. The number string will be validated to check if it's an integer number. Numbers with '.' will not be recongised as a valid number. 
2. The program does a one time conversion so no loop in the main method to continuously ask for user input.
## Prerequisites
JDK 7 or newer version
## Getting Started
run class NumberSearcher as a java application.
